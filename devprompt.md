Would it be possible to add an index to the homepage that automatically generates before a push?

The index would ideally have the contents of the /ideas folder organised alphabetically in a markdown table with:

Idea (the prettified name)
Link (that would resolve on Github)
Dev Branch - If present, added by automatic detection. If there's a github.com link in the file, the markdown badge could be copied
