# Fuzzy Search Logic

## Branch

[![Branch: Fuzzy Search Logic](https://img.shields.io/badge/Branch-fuzzy--search--logic-blue)](https://github.com/danielrosehill/homebox/tree/fuzzy-search-logic)


## The Problem

Whatever Homebox is using under the hood for search, it leaves a little bit to be desired. I frequently had trouble finding things in the inventory because I didn't match the item name exactly enough (capitalisation or hyphen differences).

Given that, being able to retrieve things quickly is the main purpose of Homebox, I think this would be the highest priority feature I could work on. 

## Plan Of Action

Firstly, develop an understanding for what the project is currently using for for search. 

Next, see how and whether fuzzier logic could be employed in the code base. 
#
Finally, try to implement it.
