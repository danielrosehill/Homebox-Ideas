# Search By Asset ID

## Description

In Homebox, items have asset IDs. 

In the search UI, you need to prepend a hashtag to the number and strip a zero in order for the search by asset ID feature to work.

When looking up lots of items in inventory in quick succession, this is very clumsy.

## Idea

A search by asset ID toggle in the main search window.

Search by asset ID prepends the hashtag and strips the leading zero so that you can just type an asset ID and get real time lookup.
